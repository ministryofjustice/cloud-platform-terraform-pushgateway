Terraform module that deploy cloud-platform prometheus pushgateway.

## Overview

The Prometheus Pushgateway is an intermediary service which allows ephemeral and batch jobs to expose its metrics to Prometheus. Since these kinds of jobs may not exist long enough to be scraped, they can instead push their metrics to a Pushgateway and the Prometheus scrapes the metrics from it. Read the [prometheus-pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway) repo for more details.

This module uses terraform's ```helm_release``` resource to deploy the ```prometheus-community/prometheus-pushgateway``` helm chart into your namespace. More information on this chart can be found here:
https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/prometheus-pushgateway


## Usage

See [this example](example/pushgateway.tf)

## Pushing Custom Metrics

Below example shows how you can push custom metrics to Pushgateway.

Using curl you can push a hard-coded metric as follows:

```echo "cpu_utilization 20.25" | curl --data-binary @- http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/my_batch_job_custom_metrics```

If you are getting `invalid metric name error`, your cmd editor might not be compatible. In that case try

```
cat <<EOF | curl --data-binary @- http://localhost:9091/metrics/job/my_batch_job_custom_metrics
cpu_utilization 20.25
EOF
```

You can view the console of Pushgateway by port forwarding the Pushgateway service.

``` kubectl port-forward service/<namespace>-pushgateway-prometheus 9091 -n <namespace> ```

Browse to ```http://localhost:9091```


Look at pushgatewayâ€™s metrics endpoint:

```
$ curl -L http://localhost:9091/metrics/ | grep cpu_utilization

# TYPE cpu_utilization untyped
cpu_utlization{job="my_batch_job_custom_metrics"} 20.25
```

You can also view the above metric in the console: http://localhost:9091/metrics

For more details on using pushgateway and pushing metrics from inside your app, check the guidance [here](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/pushing/).

## Scraping Pushgateway Metrics from Prometheus

By default, this module create a serviceMonitor resource which specifies how your pushgateway metrics can be retrieved from your pushgateway service. This will allow the prometheus-operator to monitor and pull metrics automatically from this service.
